Don't forget to install Powerline fonts from [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

My latest set-up is **Pro** (don't forget to set as default & change background opacity), with Inconsolata-dz for Powerline 16pt (with Antialias text).

### To create a symlink for Sublime

``ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl``

Now you can open the current project in Sublime from the terminal using ``subl .`` :tada:
